# Analysis of the dissemination of fake news about COVID-19 on Twitter

This project was the final work for the discipline of Visual Data Analysis of the Master degree in Mathematical Modelling at EMAp FGV. This work was done in a group: Giovani Valdrighi (me), Lucas Freire and Taisa Calvette. The object was to present a visualization tool to analyze the dissemetion of fake news about COVID-19 on Twitter using data available from [Aos Fatos](https://www.aosfatos.org/), a brazilian fact checking journal. The final result is available in a [Notebook](https://observablehq.com/d/f9d0cfd684e6783c) at Observablehq.

# Files organization

The files of the project are separated in the following folders:

- `notebooks/`: Python notebooks that includes an initial exploratory data analysis and the notebook of the topic modelling of tweets.

- `docs/`: documents with the reports of our project.

# Requirements

The final visualization can be view on a browser with no installation, everything is already working at Observablehq.  However, the data used is not public, it was solicited to Aos Fatos and a sample was given, so the Notebooks can not be reproduced. Despite that, the code can be useful to re-using it in a different dataset.
